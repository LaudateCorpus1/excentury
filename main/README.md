# Main

This directory contains a collection of tests for excentury. To make
sure that excentury runs in your system first you need to source the
`bashrc` file in the root folder of excentury (`../bashrc`) and the
one contained in this directory.

Once this is done you may call `make`. Note that the MATLAB tests
will fail if you do not have MATLAB installed.
